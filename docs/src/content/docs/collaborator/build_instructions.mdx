This document provides step-by-step instructions for building the Saturn engine and editor from source code.

---

Follow these steps to build Saturn from source.

<Steps>

1. Clone the repository and initialize all submodules.

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/saturn
   ```

2. Select a CMake **configure preset** appropriate for your platform.

3. Select a corresponding **build preset** and build the project. The vcpkg toolchain installs dependencies automatically.

</Steps>

At this point, the engine, editor, and test targets are available for your platform.

:::caution
Saturn enables Web Workers using the `-pthread` flag to preserve compatibility with native threading code. In some cases, additional flags are required to enable atomic and bulk memory features.

If the build fails with missing atomic support, patch the following file:

```
out/build/emscripten-${PROFILE}/_deps/emdawnwebgpu-src/emdawnwebgpu.port.py
```

Add the required flags manually:

```diff lang="py"
flags = ['-g', '-std=c++17', '-fno-exceptions']
+flags += ['-matomics', '-mbulk-memory']
flags += compute_library_compile_flags(settings)
```

This change enables compatibility with multi-threaded WebAssembly targets.
